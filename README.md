# COEN-390-Team-Project
A smart coffee container that uses weight and CO2 sensors to provide real time inventory tracking based on preferred consumption methods such as remaining espresso shots or pour over servings, while also monitoring CO2 levels to track coffee bean freshness and brewing window for home roasted or freshly purchased beans.

Our device utilizes a volatile organic compound (VOC) based equivalent CO2 (eCO2) sensor to monitor the degassing rate and the aromatic activity of coffee beans. As coffee quality degrades over time the rate of CO2 and VOCs reduces.  Our device tracks this rate of reduction in order to predict the beans’ shelf life, allowing coffee drinkers to optimize their typical weekly/biweekly consumption by purchasing appropriate batch sizes to eliminate waste.  Additionally, by calculating inventory based on specific consumption methods the users can know in advance whether they’ll have enough in between grocery trips or not.  Finally, since freshly roasted beans require a resting period to degas enough CO2 for proper brewing we can remove the guesswork by identifying the window where enough gas has vented to ensure high quality beans for those who are roasting their beans at home to save money or as their hobby.
